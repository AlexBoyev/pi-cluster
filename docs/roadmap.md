# Pi-Cluster Roadmap

## Phase 0 — Foundation ✓
- [x] Repository structure and documentation
- [x] Docker Compose scaffold
- [x] Backend scaffold (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic)
- [x] Frontend scaffold (React, TypeScript, Vite)
- [x] Migrations applied and API responding

## Phase 1 — Cluster Inventory ✓
- [x] Node registration API
- [x] Node listing API
- [x] Seed initial cluster nodes (pi-node1–4)
- [x] Dashboard node list

## Phase 2 — Node Health ✓
- [x] SSH connectivity check (paramiko)
- [x] CPU, memory, disk, uptime, temperature via SSH
- [x] Node status tracking (ONLINE / OFFLINE / DEGRADED / UNKNOWN)
- [x] Background health polling (30s interval, asyncio)
- [x] Health API endpoint with Redis cache (90s TTL)
- [x] Dashboard health cards with ring gauges

## Phase 3 — Observability ✓
- [x] Backend `/metrics` endpoint (prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator)
- [x] Custom Prometheus Gauges per node (CPU, RAM, disk, temp, uptime)
- [x] Prometheus scrape config
- [x] Grafana auto-provisioned datasource + dashboard
- [x] Light-blue admin UI with sidebar navigation

## Phase 4 — Authentication ✓
- [x] JWT-based login / token refresh
- [x] Protected API routes (FastAPI dependency)
- [x] Frontend auth flow (login page, token storage)
- [x] Role-based access (admin / viewer)

## Phase 5 — CI/CD Pipeline ✓
- [x] Jenkins deployed as Docker service on pi-node1 (:8080)
- [x] Jenkins pipeline for build → migrate → deploy → health check on git push
- [x] SCM polling every 2 minutes (triggers on any master push)
- [ ] Webhook from Git repo to Jenkins (optional, polling sufficient)
- [ ] Automated docker build and push to local registry

## Phase 6 — Kubernetes + GitOps ✓
- [x] K3s server on pi-node1, agents on pi-node2/3/4
- [x] ArgoCD deployed on K3s (:30443)
- [x] ArgoCD Application watching k8s/apps/ in this repo
- [x] Sample nginx workload deployed via GitOps
- [ ] Workload scheduling and placement policies

## Phase 7 — Orchestration ✓
- [x] Workload API (create / list / delete K8s deployments)
- [x] Kubernetes Python client integrating with K3s via kubeconfig
- [x] Capacity-aware placement (picks node with most free CPU)
- [x] Node cordon / uncordon via API and dashboard UI
- [x] Workloads page in frontend (deploy form, live table, capacity cards)

## Phase 8 — Load Balancing ✓
- [x] Traefik DaemonSet deployed on K3s (HostPort 80/443, IngressClass traefik)
- [x] Workload API creates K8s Service + Ingress on container_port
- [x] TLS termination via Traefik built-in self-signed cert
- [x] Ingress host auto-assigned as `<name>.pi-cluster.local`
- [x] Frontend shows ingress URL as clickable link in workloads table
